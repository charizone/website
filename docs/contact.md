As a nation, we give so much to charities every year and yet there are surprisingly few resources out there to support us in our philanthropic giving. Charizone is here to change that.

            <summary>Are you a charity?</summary>
            <p>
                Charizone is not a charity itself.  We are a mission-driven organisation, set up as a limited company, focused on achieving our purpose while ensuring financial sustainability, all while maintaining the highest standards of governance and sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why? Our goal is to strengthen the charity sector by providing the infrastructure needed to drive meaningful change, not to be a charity ourselves. As an online technology and information company, we follow sound and responsible business principles to ensure we deliver value to the donors and charities that use our platform, as well as to the sector as a whole. This model allows us to stay true to our mission, deliver excellence, and remain flexible and scalable as we grow.

            <summary>What charities coverage do you have at the moment?</summary>
            <p>
                At the moment, we're focusing on charities registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales. This is because the reporting requirements there are more detailed, allowing us to provide you with richer, more comprehensive information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we also have access to the registers for Scotland and Northern Ireland, charities registered exclusively in those regions may have incomplete data compared to those in England and Wales. We aim to offer the most accurate and complete information possible.

            <p>
                We don’t make charity recommendations, but we provide comprehensive, reliable data to help you make informed decisions about where to give. By making essential information more accessible, we empower donors and funders to give with confidence.

                We support philanthropic efforts by providing data.
            </p>

                For those already using grant management softwares, our data integrates seamlessly with most software through our API, enhancing their existing capabilities. If you have a specific system in place, get in touch, and we’ll see how we can support your existing setup.
