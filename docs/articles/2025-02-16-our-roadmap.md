At Charizone, we use data to bring funders and charities together, helping build trust and long-term relationships that create real, scalable impact.

At the heart of everything we do is a real focus on listening to our users. We’re not just building something for the sake of it; we’re creating a platform designed to make your philanthropic journey easier, more efficient, and above all, more impactful. The conversations we're having with clients and partners right now are really exciting, and I can’t wait to share more as these projects come to life.

In the meantime, here is a little sneak peek into what's on the horizon for us:

### 1. Personalising Your Data Experience

We know that every user has different needs, which is why we’re putting you in control of how you interact with your data. Soon, you’ll be able to customise search filters and portfolio views, allowing you to effortlessly find the information that’s most relevant to your philanthropic journey. Whether you’re tracking specific charities or causes, collaborating with colleagues, or comparing opportunities, these personalised views will ensure your experience is not only smoother but also perfectly aligned with your objectives.

### 2. Unlock Key Insights from Your Portfolios

We’re giving our portfolio view and dashboard a fresh new look, making it easier to see the real impact of your work across portfolios. With new graphs and data options, you’ll gain a clear, high-level view of key insights. You’ll also be able to compare portfolios in various ways, making it simpler to assess your impact and spot trends.

### 3. Opening New Doors with AI

At Charizone, we’re really excited about the possibilities AI can bring to our mission. We’re being thoughtful and cautious as we integrate it, but we’re definitely looking forward to introducing new features which we will roll once we have tested them with you first- stay tuned.

### 4. Connect with All Your Tools Seamlessly

We understand that many of you already use a variety of tools to manage your charitable activities. That’s why we’re working on making Charizone even more connected with the platforms you rely on. This integration will streamline your workflow, saving you time and making it easier than ever to stay on top of your impact.

### 5. Easier Access to Data for All

We’re committed to making charity data and insights more accessible than ever. In the near future, with our upcoming mobile app and charity-specific QR codes, key information will be right at your fingertips. This will allow you to make informed decisions on the go, ensuring access to vital data whenever you need it, not just from behind a desk.

These updates are just the beginning, and we’re more excited than ever about the direction Charizone is heading. Our team is committed to listening to your feedback and collaborating with our users to create a platform that truly makes a difference in the way we approach charitable giving.

Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being part of the Charizone community!
