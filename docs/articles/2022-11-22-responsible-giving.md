## Using data in the charity sector to inform donations

Data analytics will radically change the way we live and
do business in the future. This technological and strategic
revolution will include charities and philanthropists too.

Most of us want to make the world a
better place. We make career choices,
investment decisions and even lifestyle
changes to fulfil our roles on this journey.
There are new and innovative tools
available to help us align and integrate
our values with almost everything we do,
because we care.

And because we care, we are making
important decisions about which
charities to support and which causes
to contribute towards. Individuals in the
UK donate more than £10bn every year,
yet surprisingly, there are few resources
available to help us find charities that
match with our personal choices or
philanthropic strategies.

With over 170,000 charities to choose from
in the UK alone, is it possible for us to take
on any level of due diligence research on
our own? Why do we end up supporting
the usual charities and struggle to find the
new, lean and impactful organisations
that would promote the evolution in the
sector? Even when we do find charities
that align with our values, how can we
remain active and engaged while building
the vital long-term relationships needed
to help charities achieve more?

## The information gap

The ability to undertake diligent research
to find the ‘right charity’ is dependent on
the availability of useful and reliable data
in the public domain. It is not too hard
to prove that information regarding a
charity’s effectiveness and sustainability
is not readily available; often either
hidden within many pages of a glossy
report or too difficult to access. In fact,
such evidence is often too expensive to
produce and too complex to understand.

So, what information do we have?

Charities consistently produce annual
reports and accounts (which are
regulatory requirements), but this on
its own isn’t sufficient to gather a clear
picture about their work. Alongside this
charities use their websites as a free
space to share information with the
public and to showcase their good work.
But this space is just that – free. Each
charity chooses what it shares and how it
shares it, making it difficult to know what
information to look for.

## Bridging the gap

With a background in environmental,
social and governance (ESG) reporting
in the corporate sector, I wondered:
could we apply the data analysis
methods used in the ESG world to help
gain an understanding of a charity’s
performance? What answers would
reassure us that we are supporting a
‘good’ charity that aligns with our values?
Would such an approach be helpful to the
charities themselves?

By arranging charity data into three
themes, we can create a holistic,
standard and informative narrative about
a charity – designed to shed light on the
effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability
of any given organisation. By going one
step further, we can even compare the
data published by each charity with
existing voluntary-sector codes and
conducts of best practice – analysing
whether a charity goes above and
beyond, or completes the bare minimum.

And thus, the idea of Charizone was born.

Working closely with experts in the sector
who care deeply about charities, I began
to create a framework that considers the
following:

### Impact

By nature, every charity exists to make a
positive impact. While measuring impact
is extremely difficult and expensive,
we would still need to know that the
intervention the charity is implementing
actually works. Following guidance
from charities SORP (Statement of
Recommended Practice), we can expect
all charities, big or small, to reliably and
transparently report on how effective
they are in achieving their charitable
mission. There are several resources and
tools available to charities from sources
such as Social Value UK and NCVO to
aid charities in the process, giving us a
suitable benchmark to compare charities
against.

### Governance

Good governance is reflected in a
charity’s compliance with the law
and relevant regulations, along with
adherence to best practice. The board
of trustees is responsible for the
mission and the assets of a charity. In
fact, how a charity is managed and
operated is key to understanding its
effectiveness, focus and priorities.

In light of recent scandals in the sector,
just ‘good’ governance isn’t enough
when considering the complexity of
running an organisation. The Charity
Governance Code, now in its 12th year
and its 3rd edition, offers a practical
tool to help charities and their trustees
develop high standards of governance
– making it another ideal variable for
comparative research.

### Finance

Finally, the finances of a charity are
the monetary resources necessary
for its sustainability, resilience and
survival. Whilst every charity has a
different business model, we can
expect all charities to demonstrate their
sustainability and resilience – after all, a
defaulting charity could cause more harm
and undo all the good work that it has
done over the years. The charities SORP
sets out how charities should prepare
their annual accounts and report on their
finances. We therefore have standards
that allow us to recognise charities with
good financial management.

## Introducing Charizone

The information needed to structure
reporting under these headings is found
in various public sources such as annual
reports, charity websites and other
publications made available by the
charity. In addition, the data itself can
be either objective in nature or require
further subjective analysis. Thus, while
this framework works in theory, manually
gathering this information for multiple
charities is time consuming to say the
least.

However, when combined with
technology, learnings from the private
sector, and a team of dedicated people
who just don’t take ‘no’ for an answer,
we’ve found a way to make timely and
affordable due diligence research into the
charitable sector a very real possibility.

It is important to know that there is no
perfect framework for deciding whether
a charity is effective or efficient; the
subjective nature of this topic renders
that level of due diligence expensive
and mainly justifiable for very large
donations. But that shouldn’t stop donors
from asking the right questions and
demanding evidence from the charities
they’re willing to support.

This is the stake in the ground, motivated
by a long-term commitment to the
charity sector. An idea that creates
sector standards – inspiring charities
to achieve more, while creating and
facilitating engagement and stewardship
for philanthropists to nurture new and
existing charitable relationships.

Easily digestible reports that collate data
from a number of sources, designed
to give insight, aid comparison and
become a cornerstone for due diligence
research into the charitable sector. That’s
our solution, hopefully empowering
philanthropists and wealth managers
to feel that they’re using their wealth for
good.

### The call

The charitable sector is dependent
on its donors more now than ever. By
demanding answers to practical and
important questions and holding charities
accountable we, as a community,
are forging two-way dialogues with
charities, promoting sector standards,
and ensuring that information crucial for
building the trust and legitimacy of this
sector’s work becomes readily available.

_Our Charizone framework is developed in
line with guidance from experts within this
sector as a tool to support good reporting
and transparency. We’re a young platform at
the beginning of our journey, and welcome
all constructive feedback. Find out more at
