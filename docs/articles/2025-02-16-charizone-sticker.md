### Redefining Charity Assessment: Charizone’s Mission to Empower Philanthropy

In a world where philanthropy has the power to create real change, Charizone’s goal is clear: to build a more informed and accountable charity sector where both donors and charities can flourish.

We know that the charity landscape can be complex. Charities, despite the incredible work they do, often struggle to clearly demonstrate their impact, while donors, eager to make a difference, face challenges in choosing where to give. That’s where Charizone comes in, helping both sides navigate these challenges with our Charity Performance Framework.

### Our Charity Performance Framework

The Charity Performance Framework provides a comprehensive view of a charity’s operations, governance, impact, and financial health. It’s not just a tool for donors; charities that opt for our independent evaluation gain valuable insights into their strengths and areas for improvement. We focus on helping charities not only understand their current performance but also plan for sustainable growth in the future.

For philanthropists, it’s a game-changer. No more basing decisions on ambiguous data or personal stories. With clear, comparable data, donors can make informed decisions based on a charity’s real impact.

### The Charizone Sticker: A Mark of Trust

A key result of the Charity Performance Framework is the Charizone sticker. This symbol of trust represents a charity’s commitment to transparency, accountability, and continual improvement. It’s earned through rigorous, independent evaluations, not given away lightly. While platforms like Charity Navigator help U.S.-based donors assess nonprofits, Charizone’s sticker is awarded only to charities that undergo our detailed performance assessment.

The Charizone sticker signals to donors that a charity is dedicated to maintaining high standards and being open about its operations. For charities, it serves as a reminder of their commitment to best practices, both internally and in the eyes of their supporters.

### The Collective Power of the Sticker

Imagine a future where more charities proudly display the Charizone sticker. This growing movement could redefine the charity sector, shifting the focus from intuition-based decisions to data-driven ones. With this shift, donors would feel empowered to support charities they trust, knowing they’re backed by clear, reliable and independent data.

More importantly, this would inspire charities to continually raise their standards, exceeding the expectations set by donors, regulators, and the communities they serve.

### A Path Forward: Charizone’s Growing Impact

We’re excited to see how the Charizone sticker and our Charity Performance Framework will shape the charity sector. Our ultimate goal is to create a future where transparency is the norm, charities can showcase their progress freely, and donors can confidently make decisions based on clear data.

The Charizone sticker is just one tool in the toolbox. Together, we can create a more accountable, effective, and trusted charity sector — one that leads to a greater positive impact on the causes that matter most.
